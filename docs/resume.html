    I was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, and lived there for a
    total of 12 years. In 2017, we moved back to Erie, PA and I have been here ever since. I
    enjoy Erie more than I do Gulfport, specifically: <ol>
        <li>#1 the weather </li>
        <li>#2 the people </li>
        <li>#3 the location </li>
        <li>#4 the sights</li>
        <li>#5 the possibilities</li>
    </ol> Enjoy this link to my hometown: <a>https://www.gulfport-ms.gov/</a>
    <em>Some of my hobbies include: filmmaking, writing, reading, and traveling.</em>
